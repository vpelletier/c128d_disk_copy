Block-based copier for Commodore 128D

Written to:

- rescue surviving childhood diskettes, moving them to modern storage using an sd2iec
- write readable basic, without any GOTO (so bring your own line numbers !)
- ... and a tiny bit of assembly, too, for the inner loop
- put in practice bits from the "Commodore 128 Book 4: 1571 Internals" book

Displays which track & sector number had a read error, and continues.
